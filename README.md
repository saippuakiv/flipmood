## Data Setup

The app uses pre-processed recommendation data.
Current Setup: The existing data/enriched-mood-mapping.json was generated from the current data/raw-recommendations.ts as an example.
To customize with your own data:

Add your recommendations: Edit data/raw-recommendations.ts to add your own movie and music data
Generate processed data: Run the enrichment script to create the final data file:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/enrich-recommendations.ts
```

This will generate a new data/enriched-mood-mapping.json used by the app

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Mood**: Describe what kind of entertainment you're looking for
2. **Browse Cards**: View movie recommendations and listen to music tracks via Spotify embed
